<h1>Learning How to Do Algorithms</h1>

<p>Algorithms are something I dread. Recently, I missed out on an awesome opportunity because I freaked on my 2nd algorithm problem. I realized I don't usually go about these problems in a logistical way. I want to address this.</p>

<p>They say the best way to learn is to practice... so I'll be starting with the basics.</p>

<h2><em>How do you go about tackling an Algorithm or White Board Challenge?</em></h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>State/Write out the Question:</strong> You want to make sure that you understand what the interviewer is asking.</li>
    <li><strong>List the Parameters: </strong> Define the inputs with meaningful names</li>
    <li><strong>State your Return: </strong> Make sure you are retrieving what they are asking</li>
    <li><strong>Examples: </strong>Have a few testcases (negative, 0, and positive)</li>
    <li><strong>Pseudocode: </strong>Describe logic in comments</li>
    <li><strong>Debug Test Cases</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Pseudocode --> Code</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Always talk out loud to your interviewer. Ask for help if necessary.</p>
